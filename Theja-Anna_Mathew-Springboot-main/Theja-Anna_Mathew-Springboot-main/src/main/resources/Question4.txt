Qn4. In this project, we have used the name of data members(id, name),same as the columns of the Database.
   If I use different names in the data member( e.g: ItemName instead of name ), will I be able to pull the data from Database?
       i. If yes, how?
       i.If no, why ?

Ans: No, it is not possible to pull data from database if we have different names in data member and database column.
     We can change the column name using column annotation @Column(name = " ").
